It’s about the day job; it’s about the language.  -- Stephen King | On Writing</blockquote><p>The title "On Coding" is not only a homage to that wonderful work, but a reminder that software development is more "craft" than "science".  This series on coding won't be focused on any specific language, solution, or technology; but will instead focus on the day job, how it's done, and the craft of writing software.</p><h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?  </h2><p>Consider that it's not the plot, but the <em>truth</em> of the characters in a story.  It's not the realism, but the <em>meaningful abstraction</em> of a painting.  It's not the notes, but the <em>idea</em> that a song conveys.  Like all crafts, what distinguishes the bad from good in software development, is the creation of that which exceeds<em> the functional; </em>and in order to progress in the craft you must recognize and address realties beyond the mundane problem of "getting it to work".</p><p>However, much like Stephen King's experience with fans, <strong>no one ever asks about craft and very few developers talk about it</strong>.  This is the inspiration for these musings and my attempt to distinguish what matters from the rest.</p><h2 id="how-is-the-most-important-part">How is the Most Important Part</h2><p>Because our craft evolves at such a rapid pace, we not only need to assimilate new information and skills, but also need to adapt our current work to those changes midstream.  The only way to do this is to become obsessive about the “How” of our craft in a way that our current efforts will not be undone by future changes in staffing or technology.</p><p>I'm probably a little ahead of myself, so let's take a step back and define a couple of terms. I cribbed the following from Simon Sinek’s <a href="https://startwithwhy.com/">Start with Why</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>“Why”</strong> is your purpose, cause, or belief.  Yes, it’s the most important thing you need to consider, but you really should understand your <strong>“Why”</strong> long before tackling the craft of coding.  If you don’t know what is driving you or your business beyond the pursuit of money, you really ought to <a href="https://startwithwhy.com/">Start with Why</a>.</li><li><strong>“How”</strong> is your process.  In other words the design, structure, or methodology you use to create your work product.  I.e. Coding Standards, Agile Development, Continuous Delivery, etc.</li><li><strong>“What”</strong> is your work product.  In other words the code, language, hardware, and general technology that is or drives your solution.  I.e. a SASS application written in Ruby for managing public meeting spaces.</li></ul><p>If you're just focused on "What" you're making, your work product is probably inconstant; making it hard to use, maintain, adapt, and test.  When change comes - very shortly - you'll probably spend more time than you have adjusting your current work product to the new reality.</p><p>Instead, if you're focused on "How" your work product is made, you've almost certainly adopted standards (good or bad) that will help you change things, structure that will stand up to change, and methodology that will give you clear direction.  Adaptation is never painless, but with the right focus it can be addressed in a way that doesn't kill your work.</p><p>Learning, understanding, and improving the "How" of our craft will be the focus of this series.</p><h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2><p>There's one other reason I chose to pay homage to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=On+Writing&amp;qid=1579475384&amp;sr=8-1">On Writing</a> in this series: I believe that our craft has a lot more in common with <strong><em>formal writing</em></strong><em> </em>than most people think<strong>.</strong></p><p>Almost everywhere coding is taught, it’s linked to science, engineering, and mathematics with an emphasis on course work in these related subjects. Professionals have titles like Developer, Engineer, and Architect.  We use concepts and terms borrowed from manufacturing like “Lean”, “Quality Assurance”, and “Product”;  and while most of those concepts DO apply ... they present an incomplete picture.</p><p>We also make an abstract and intangible product.  The cost to distribute this product to millions is not that much more significant than cost to distribute it to thousands.  We write, re-write, and re-build frequently; something that is very cost prohibitive in physical manufacturing.  And most importantly, other than in a handful of specialized cases, <strong>modern software development is practically unconcerned with the science of computing</strong>.  </p><p>As an industry, we have substituted a focus on algorithms, graphs, and data structures; with the daily work of understanding contracts, improving user experience, and meeting release deadlines.  We spend far more time reviewing work, reading documentation, and understanding our audience than we do on anything even remotely resembling math, science, and engineering.</p><p>And while my intent isn't to convince you of the strong link between writing and coding, the idea certainly highlights some interesting concepts and is a good example of the ideas I'll be trying to tackle through-out this series.</p><p>‌‌</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
